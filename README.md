# MEGS ECOMM

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is simply a small e-commerce project. It is built with chakra UI and is integrated with the paystack payment solution.

It does handle user Login and registration and contact and transaction recording by talking with a laravel backend hosted on heroku. 

Redux also comes to play here. However though, its products are locally stored.
